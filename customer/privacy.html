                                    Obtain a paper copy of the Notice upon request. You may request a copy of the Notice at any time. Even if you have agreed to receive the Notice electronically, you are still entitled to a paper copy. To obtain a paper copy, contact your local Giant Eagle pharmacist or Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. You may obtain an electronic copy of this Notice at www.gianteagle.com.

                                    Request a restriction on certain uses and disclosures of PHI. You have the right to request additional restrictions on our use or disclosure of PHI about you by sending a written request to Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. We are not required to agree to those restrictions; unless the restriction is for a disclosure to a health plan for health services or items paid out-of-pocket in full, unless such a disclosure is required by law. Our Pharmacies generally transmit prescriptions electronically to health plans when your prescription is received electronically (not when you pick up the prescription). If you wish to request that we not disclose the prescription to your health plan, you should obtain a paper prescription and make the request for restriction at the time you present the paper prescription to our Pharmacy.

                                    Inspect and obtain a copy of PHI. You have the right to access and copy PHI about you contained in a designated record set for as long as the Pharmacy maintains the PHI. The designated record set usually will include prescription and billing records. We may impose charges for the cost involved in providing copies, such as labor, supplies, and postage, as permitted by law. If your records are maintained electronically, you have the right to specify that the records you requested are to be provided in electronic form. We will accommodate your request for a specific electronic form or format as long as we are able to readily produce a copy in the requested form or format. If we cannot do so, we will work with you to reach agreement on an alternative readable electronic form. To inspect or copy PHI about you, you must send a written request to your local Giant Eagle pharmacist or Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238 (certain requests may be verbal). We may charge you a fee for the costs of copying, mailing and supplies that are necessary to fulfill your request. We may deny your request to inspect and copy in certain limited circumstances. If you are denied access to PHI about you, you may request that the denial be reviewed

                                    Request an amendment of PHI. If you feel that PHI we maintain about you in a designated record set is incomplete or incorrect, you may request that we amend it. You may request an amendment for as long as we maintain the PHI in a designated record set. To request an amendment, you must send a written request to Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. You must include a reason that supports your request. In certain cases, we may deny your request for amendment. If we deny your request for amendment, you have the right to file a statement of disagreement with the decision and we may give a rebuttal to your statement.

                                    Receive an accounting of disclosures of PHI. You have the right to receive an accounting of the disclosures we have made of PHI about you for most purposes other than treatment, payment, or health care operations. The accounting will exclude certain disclosures, such as disclosures made directly to you, disclosures you authorize, disclosures to friends or family members involved in your care, and disclosures for notification purposes. The right to receive an accounting is subject to certain other exceptions, restrictions, and limitations. To request an accounting, you must submit a request in writing to Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer, 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. Your request must specify the time period, but the time period may not be longer than six years prior to the date you make your request. The first accounting time period you request within a 12 month period will be provided free of charge, but you may be charged for the cost of providing additional accountings. We will notify you of the cost involved and you may choose to withdraw or modify your request at that time.

To request confidential communication of PHI about you, you must submit a request in writing to the Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer, 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. Your request must state how or where you would like to be contacted. We will accommodate all reasonable requests.

                                    We will use PHI for payment. Example: We will contact your insurer or pharmacy benefit manager to determine whether it will pay for your prescription and the amount of your copayment. We will bill you or a third-party payor for the cost of prescription medications dispensed to you. The information on or accompanying the bill may include information that identifies you, as well as the prescriptions you are taking. We will use PHI for health care operations. Example: The Pharmacy may use information in your health record to monitor the performance of the pharmacists providing treatment to you. This information will be used in an effort to continually improve the quality and effectiveness of the health care and service we provide.

Examples include accountants, auditors and others who provide services involving your PHI such as records storage or destruction companies. When these services are contracted for, we may disclose PHI about you to our business associate so that they can perform the job we have asked them to do and bill you or your third-party payor for services rendered. To protect PHI about you, we require the business associate to enter into written agreements to appropriately safeguard the PHI.
