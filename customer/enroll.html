INFORMATION WE PROVIDE

We try to make our Sites a place you feel comfortable visiting and using, and while we cannot guarantee every statement on the Sites is accurately communicated, we do work hard to make sure the information we provide is thorough and accurate. From recipes, to health notices, to nutritional and labeling information, to special offers, and information contained in our pharmacy section, our goal is to keep you informed about your shopping experience.

Always consult a certified medical or health professional about information you find on our Sites that you believe affects you, including any prescription medicines or medical information; or before you embark on any diet, exercise, purchase, or lifestyle change. We may also provide information about products available in our stores or online.

                       Giant Eagle®, Inc. Privacy Policy

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of the Site. The Notice also describes your rights with respect to PHI about you. Upon request, we will provide any revised Notice to you. We will also make copies available at our Pharmacies and post the new Notice on our website, www.gianteagle.com.

1. What information do we collect about you?
The Pharmacy is required by law to maintain the privacy of Protected Health Information ("PHI") and to provide individuals with notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to PHI.
PHI is information that may identify you and that relates to your past, present or future physical or mental health or condition and related health care services or payment for those services.

2. How do we use your information
This Notice of Privacy Practices ("Notice") describes how we may use and disclose PHI to carry out treatment, payment or health care operations and for other specified purposes that are permitted or required by law.
The Pharmacy is required to follow the terms of this Notice. We will not use or disclose PHI about you without your written authorization, except as described in this Notice. We reserve the right to change our practices and this Notice and to make the new Notice effective for all PHI we maintain.

3. What is your health information choice?
Obtain a paper copy of the Notice upon request. You may request a copy of the Notice at any time. Even if you have agreed to receive the Notice electronically, you are still entitled to a paper copy. To obtain a paper copy, contact your local Giant Eagle pharmacist or Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. You may obtain an electronic copy of this Notice at www.gianteagle.com.
Request a restriction on certain uses and disclosures of PHI. You have the right to request additional restrictions on our use or disclosure of PHI about you by sending a written request to Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. We are not required to agree to those restrictions; unless the restriction is for a disclosure to a health plan for health services or items paid out-of-pocket in full, unless such a disclosure is required by law. Our Pharmacies generally transmit prescriptions electronically to health plans when your prescription is received electronically (not when you pick up the prescription). If you wish to request that we not disclose the prescription to your health plan, you should obtain a paper prescription and make the request for restriction at the time you present the paper prescription to our Pharmacy.
Inspect and obtain a copy of PHI. You have the right to access and copy PHI about you contained in a designated record set for as long as the Pharmacy maintains the PHI. The designated record set usually will include prescription and billing records. We may impose charges for the cost involved in providing copies, such as labor, supplies, and postage, as permitted by law. If your records are maintained electronically, you have the right to specify that the records you requested are to be provided in electronic form. We will accommodate your request for a specific electronic form or format as long as we are able to readily produce a copy in the requested form or format. If we cannot do so, we will work with you to reach agreement on an alternative readable electronic form. To inspect or copy PHI about you, you must send a written request to your local Giant Eagle pharmacist or Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238 (certain requests may be verbal). We may charge you a fee for the costs of copying, mailing and supplies that are necessary to fulfill your request. We may deny your request to inspect and copy in certain limited circumstances. If you are denied access to PHI about you, you may request that the denial be reviewed.
Request an amendment of PHI. If you feel that PHI we maintain about you in a designated record set is incomplete or incorrect, you may request that we amend it. You may request an amendment for as long as we maintain the PHI in a designated record set. To request an amendment, you must send a written request to Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. You must include a reason that supports your request. In certain cases, we may deny your request for amendment. If we deny your request for amendment, you have the right to file a statement of disagreement with the decision and we may give a rebuttal to your statement.
Receive an accounting of disclosures of PHI. You have the right to receive an accounting of the disclosures we have made of PHI about you for most purposes other than treatment, payment, or health care operations. The accounting will exclude certain disclosures, such as disclosures made directly to you, disclosures you authorize, disclosures to friends or family members involved in your care, and disclosures for notification purposes. The right to receive an accounting is subject to certain other exceptions, restrictions, and limitations. To request an accounting, you must submit a request in writing to Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer, 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. Your request must specify the time period, but the time period may not be longer than six years prior to the date you make your request. The first accounting time period you request within a 12 month period will be provided free of charge, but you may be charged for the cost of providing additional accountings. We will notify you of the cost involved and you may choose to withdraw or modify your request at that time.
Request communications of PHI by alternative means or at alternative locations. For instance, you may request that we contact you about medical matters only in writing or at a different residence or post office box. To request confidential communication of PHI about you, you must submit a request in writing to the Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer, 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. Your request must state how or where you would like to be contacted. We will accommodate all reasonable requests.

4. How we may use or disclose PHI?
We will use PHI for treatment. Example: Information obtained by the pharmacist will be used to dispense prescription medications to you. We will document in your record information related to the medications dispensed to you and services provided to you as part of our interest in your treatment. We may also send you refill reminders, new product offers and other services information.
We will use PHI for payment. Example: We will contact your insurer or pharmacy benefit manager to determine whether it will pay for your prescription and the amount of your copayment.

                       THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.

The Pharmacy is required by law to maintain the privacy of Protected Health Information ("PHI") and to provide individuals with notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to PHI. PHI is information that may identify you and that relates to your past, present or future physical or mental health or condition and related health care services or payment for those services. This Notice of Privacy Practices ("Notice") describes how we may use and disclose PHI to carry out treatment, payment or health care operations and for other specified purposes that are permitted or required by law. The Notice also describes your rights with respect to PHI about you.

The Pharmacy is required to follow the terms of this Notice. We will not use or disclose PHI about you without your written authorization, except as described in this Notice. We reserve the right to change our practices and this Notice and to make the new Notice effective for all PHI we maintain. Upon request, we will provide any revised Notice to you. We will also make copies available at our Pharmacies and post the new Notice on our website, www.gianteagle.com.

Your Health Information Rights
You have the following rights with respect to PHI about you:

Obtain a paper copy of the Notice upon request. You may request a copy of the Notice at any time. Even if you have agreed to receive the Notice electronically, you are still entitled to a paper copy. To obtain a paper copy, contact your local Giant Eagle pharmacist or Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. You may obtain an electronic copy of this Notice at www.gianteagle.com.

Request a restriction on certain uses and disclosures of PHI. You have the right to request additional restrictions on our use or disclosure of PHI about you by sending a written request to Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. We are not required to agree to those restrictions; unless the restriction is for a disclosure to a health plan for health services or items paid out-of-pocket in full, unless such a disclosure is required by law. Our Pharmacies generally transmit prescriptions electronically to health plans when your prescription is received electronically (not when you pick up the prescription). If you wish to request that we not disclose the prescription to your health plan, you should obtain a paper prescription and make the request for restriction at the time you present the paper prescription to our Pharmacy.

Inspect and obtain a copy of PHI. You have the right to access and copy PHI about you contained in a designated record set for as long as the Pharmacy maintains the PHI. The designated record set usually will include prescription and billing records. We may impose charges for the cost involved in providing copies, such as labor, supplies, and postage, as permitted by law. If your records are maintained electronically, you have the right to specify that the records you requested are to be provided in electronic form. We will accommodate your request for a specific electronic form or format as long as we are able to readily produce a copy in the requested form or format. If we cannot do so, we will work with you to reach agreement on an alternative readable electronic form. To inspect or copy PHI about you, you must send a written request to your local Giant Eagle pharmacist or Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238 (certain requests may be verbal). We may charge you a fee for the costs of copying, mailing and supplies that are necessary to fulfill your request. We may deny your request to inspect and copy in certain limited circumstances. If you are denied access to PHI about you, you may request that the denial be reviewed.

Request an amendment of PHI. If you feel that PHI we maintain about you in a designated record set is incomplete or incorrect, you may request that we amend it. You may request an amendment for as long as we maintain the PHI in a designated record set. To request an amendment, you must send a written request to Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer at 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. You must include a reason that supports your request. In certain cases, we may deny your request for amendment. If we deny your request for amendment, you have the right to file a statement of disagreement with the decision and we may give a rebuttal to your statement.

Receive an accounting of disclosures of PHI. You have the right to receive an accounting of the disclosures we have made of PHI about you for most purposes other than treatment, payment, or health care operations. The accounting will exclude certain disclosures, such as disclosures made directly to you, disclosures you authorize, disclosures to friends or family members involved in your care, and disclosures for notification purposes. The right to receive an accounting is subject to certain other exceptions, restrictions, and limitations. To request an accounting, you must submit a request in writing to Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer, 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. Your request must specify the time period, but the time period may not be longer than six years prior to the date you make your request. The first accounting time period you request within a 12 month period will be provided free of charge, but you may be charged for the cost of providing additional accountings. We will notify you of the cost involved and you may choose to withdraw or modify your request at that time.

Request communications of PHI by alternative means or at alternative locations. For instance, you may request that we contact you about medical matters only in writing or at a different residence or post office box. To request confidential communication of PHI about you, you must submit a request in writing to the Giant Eagle, Inc. Pharmacy Privacy Officer, 101 Kappa Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238. Your request must state how or where you would like to be contacted. We will accommodate all reasonable requests.

Examples of How We May Use and Disclose PHI
The following are descriptions and examples of ways we use and disclose PHI:

We will use PHI for treatment. Example: Information obtained by the pharmacist will be used to dispense prescription medications to you.

To protect PHI about you, we require the business associate to enter into written agreements to appropriately safeguard the PHI.
